# PawPortal
PawPortal is a user-friendly platform designed for a veterinary clinic and its clients - pet owners, to streamline pet health management. The app allows a vet to manage appointments, track pet health records, and communicate directly with pet owners. Pet owners can easily book appointments, view their pets' medical history, and receive important notifications, ensuring seamless care for their furry friends.

This project is aimed at providing a convenient digital solution for better pet care and communication between a vet and his patients' owners.

# Sveltekit tailwind boilerplate

I have used a Sveltekit and tailwind boilerplate from https://github.com/HZ-HBO-ICT/ms-svelte-tailwindcss-boilerplate - provided by rimmertzelle.

## Developing

Install dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
